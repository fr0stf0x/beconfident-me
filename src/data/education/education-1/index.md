I built an Android app called **AirMessenger** in 2018. Its main function is real time messaging. The source code is [here](https://github.com/fr0stf0x/Air-Messenger)

After an internship at FPT Software, along with Spring, I started to learn JavaScript, jQuery to make ajax call, or dynamic render.

I loved JS so much that decided to learn Angular (at that time, was version 6) at home with some courses at [PluralSight](https://PluralSight.com)

At the end of 2018, the school project was made of ReactJS, so I and my friends self taught it and made a *hotel management* app called **Bright Hotel**. The source code is [here](https://github.com/fr0stf0x/bright-hotel)

Two months later, next project was made of React-native, I again self taught and made an *ordering management* app called **Ruby**. The source code is [here](https://github.com/fr0stf0x/Ruby)
